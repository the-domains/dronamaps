  Maps are the very basis of humanity’s grander vision. And flying is every
  human’s instinctual passion! To plan anything, be that a war or peace effort,
  or a ship sailing to the other side — humanity has always relied on maps which
  give us an aerial view to tell us the larger picture. What better than to
  actually have micro-aircrafts flying all over the world constantly giving us
  immediate high resolution imagery that change the way we look at our world. Or
  more precisely, unmanned aircrafts, or drones. Drones that care about our
  privacy with advanced machine learning and cutting edge technology, and give
  us immense data intelligence at the same time — truly things which when
  brought together will change the world not just virtually but physically and
  for good.

Maps are the very basis of humanity's grander vision. And flying is every human's instinctual passion! To plan anything, be that a war or peace effort, or a ship sailing to the other side --- humanity has always relied on maps which give us an aerial view to tell us the larger picture. What better than to actually have micro-aircrafts flying all over the world constantly giving us immediate high resolution imagery that change the way we look at our world. Or more precisely, unmanned aircrafts, or drones. Drones that care about our privacy with advanced machine learning and cutting edge technology, and give us immense data intelligence at the same time --- truly things which when brought together will change the world not just virtually but physically and for good.

We at DronaMaps feel that while maps show us the bigger picture in any scenario, the close-up shouldn't be missed. For that, we redefine mapping with large scale centimeter level maps. I'm sure we must all have been in a situation where satellite maps or inaccurate maps put us in a problem. Cartography is macro and micro at the same time, the bridge between the two worlds. Often, we as humans have failed to recognize the importance of one in perspective of the other.

We do everything from ultra high-resolution maps (centimeter level) to 3D models. We are efficiently mapping large scale areas with resolutions that let you see the cracks on the roads, if not all way to the inside of it!

Mapping at such scale and precision cannot be achieved through satellites because of obvious reasons - atmospheric conditions, clouds, resolution, etc. However, with the use of advanced UAVs, we are able to map at large scale with highly accurate centimeter level resolution and then use these maps as a baseline to assess, respond and recommend systematic changes using scientific data and expertise.

## Making Hearts Fly

We work across all verticals and possibilities. On one hand, we handle Security, Crowd Management, Disaster Planning, Evacuation and Relief Efforts, Inspections and Safety, while on the other hand we also do Rural and Urban Development, District and State Planning, Revenue Analysis, Crop Analysis. Our ambitions go as high as researching Organ Transplant Deliveries with drones, and we have a date fixed for the day a live heart takes off in our drone and successfully save a life!

Drones are going to be everywhere. We mean it, because it is a technology so reachable, second only to the mobile phones which you can carry in your pocket!

Mapping remains the baseline of everything that we do. We intend to use these maps through and through for everything humanely and practically possible, because we firmly believe that the bigger picture shouldn't compromise on the granularity of any situation.
