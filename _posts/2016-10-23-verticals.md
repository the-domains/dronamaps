# Verticals

Drones are a means to get the job done. It is the world's greatest enabler after mobile phones. You can have a micro drone for indoors, and make anything fly, or a full scale _Aquila _--- your call. Regardless of the category of the drone, what it does is give a third free dimension to any payload of our choice.

DronaMaps takes pride in starting with the verticals that we assessed on the basis of urgency. Every work we do, we like to classify as the need-of-the-hour. Everything else comes secondary.

## DronaSee --- _Security & Surveillance_

When you think about drones, a very obvious part that comes to mind is live-monitoring. Be it any event, or large scale national security --- drones have always enabled our hi-tech and ever improving cameras to fly and keep _eyes_ on situations.

DronaMaps uses it's maps as a baseline for planning any Security Operation and aims to execute it with mission-level readiness. We provide constant day-and-night monitoring at 4K resolution using multiple Artificially Intelligent drone-deployment that use on-board visual intelligence to achieve their target in the safest and most reliable way possible using automation. Advanced aviation technology helps us maintain reliability even in the most extreme circumstances, thanks to tens of years of research into the industry.

Use Cases: End-to-End City Monitoring System using multiple drones, Event Monitoring, and any high-definition visual intelligence system.
